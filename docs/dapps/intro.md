# Introduction

Pimlico helps you earn more from your on-chain application through making it more user-friendly by paying for your usersâ€™ gas fees when they use your Dapp. ðŸš€

With Pimlico, you are able to seamlessly start sponsoring User Operations while we take care of all the techincal integration.

Signing up consists of two easy steps:
1. You tell us under what conditions you want to sponsor User Operations.[^1]
2. You then transfer some tokens to our gas tank or send some fiat to our bank account. We will use these tokens or the fiat to sponsor User Operations on your behalf.[^2]

That's it! We take care of the rest. There is no need to integrate any APIs, or maintain any infrastructure. 

If you are interested in signing an API key and having us help you integrate Pimlico into your smart contract wallet, please fill out our [interest form](https://u2fnk0lj4et.typeform.com/to/ZxnyuGXv) or reach out to us at contact@pimlico.io. We aim to respond as soon as possible, usually in a couple hours.

[^1]: For instance, you might decide to sponsor the first 10 User Operations each user makes calling the `swap` or `stake` in your smart contract with at least $100 of value. We will work with you to figure out the best conditions to choose to get the best bang for your buck.
[^2]: Your can transfer any tradeable tokens to our gas tank, including your own project token.
