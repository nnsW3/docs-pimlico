# Introduction

If you are building a smart contract wallet, Pimlico allows you to get your users' User Operations sponsored by integrating just one API call, for free with no upfront or recurring costs, and no strings attached. In addition, we give forward you a part of the revenue we make, providing a valuable revenue stream for you in addition to the UX benefits your users get.
