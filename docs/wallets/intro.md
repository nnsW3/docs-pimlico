# Introduction

If you are building a smart contract wallet, Pimlico allows you to get your users' User Operations sponsored by integrating just one API call, for free with no upfront or recurring costs (no strings attached). In addition, we give forward you a part of the revenue we make, providing you with a valuable revenue stream on top of the UX benefits your users get.

If you are interested in receiving an API key and having us help you integrate Pimlico into your smart contract wallet, please fill out our [interest form](https://u2fnk0lj4et.typeform.com/to/ZxnyuGXv) or reach out to us at contact@pimlico.io. We aim to respond as soon as possible, usually in a couple of hours.
